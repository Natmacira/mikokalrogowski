    <p>I'm ethnically Silesian, born in Katowice, Poland and currently based in Munich, Germany. In between these two points in time I practiced and taught law, traveled a fair bit and managed to take some photographs. Photography has always been a part of my life. I grew up watching my granddad’s slide shows and playing around in my mom’s darkroom. Photographing became one of my main ways of expression and reflection during the time I spent living in China. I’m particularly interested in our relation to photography and how images travel through cultures. In the last couple of years I’ve taken a keen interest in the medium of Polaroids.
        I want to continue using photography as a means of self-dialogue, reflection and hope that every now and then others also find something in these pictures.
